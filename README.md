# Zombie Startup Compiler

At the time of writing this, I had a total of one year's professional experience as an intern. I had already seen three layoffs and one company completely shut down its operations in Brazil. These are crazy times for tech dudes.

As a parody, I'm going to build a programming language capable of simulating the finances in the life cycle of a startup. Anyone who can type on a computer can simulate a company's decisions and see if it survives or dies. I'm not even talking about success, but at least survival.

## Language Grammar Description (EBNF)


## Code Example

```
create startup with name blob.

blob cash is 100000.
blob monthly revenue is 10000.
blob monthly expenses is 15000.
blob founders team size is 3.
blob product is some useless OpenAI wrapper.

create venture firm with name daddy.
daddy fund has 100000000.
daddy portfolio has 3 startups.
daddy investment strategy is spray and pray.

while blob cash is not less than 0, blob asks decision, blob operates decision, blob shows unit economics.

blob raises 1000000 from daddy.

create worker with name enzo.
enzo salary is 40000.
enzo company is FAANG.
enzo role is product manager.

blob hires enzo.

while blob cash is not less than 0, blob monthly revenue increases 5000, blob monthly expenses increases 10000, daddy shows "Blob is going to die, hire more FAANG workers!!!".

if blob team is greater than 0, blob layoffs.
blob shows unit economics.
blob dies.

daddy shows "What? I have never invested in blob. He is crazy for posting that on X.".

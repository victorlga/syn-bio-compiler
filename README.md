# Zombie Startup Compiler

At the time of writing this, I had a total of one year's professional experience as an intern. I had already seen three layoffs and one company completely shut down its operations in Brazil. These are crazy times for tech dudes.

As a parody, I'm going to build a programming language capable of simulating the finances in the life cycle of a startup. Anyone who can type on a computer can simulate a company's decisions and see if it survives or dies. I'm not even talking about success, but at least survival.
